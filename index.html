I'm dedicating The 1975's "About You" to you.  The song's poignant lyrics and melody perfectly capture the emotions I've felt for you.  From the longing in the verses to the vulnerability in the chorus, every note resonates with the depth of my feelings.  I hope listening to it will convey the sincerity and affection I hold for you, more eloquently than words could ever express.  It's a small token, but I hope it shows just how much you mean to me.

This song, "About You," isn't just a dedication; it's a testament to the impact you've had on my life.  The way the music unfolds mirrors the journey of my feelings for youâ€”a gradual unfolding of affection, admiration, and a profound connection. I hope you'll appreciate this gesture and understand the unspoken words contained within the music.  Thank you for being you.
